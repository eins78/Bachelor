# The Process of Writing



## People

**author**(s)

:   The author is, obviously, the most important person of any publication. \
    It is the person or people responsible or creating the content.
    If there are several co-authors, a strategy for managing them has to be devised.


**editor**

:   An editor does not create content, but does contribute editorial changes, correcting errors, etc.


## Phases

**Draft**

:   The earliest stage of any document. The content is still evolving.


**Edit**

:   The content is mostly finished. Proofreading and other content-polishing occurs.


**Publish**

:   The content is final. Now, the output is checked for errors.


**Update** 

:   Sometimes, there are updates to a document, be it for correcting errors or incorporating new information.


## Tools


## Communication


### README

The most easy way and fool-proof to communicate inside a project is, 
like the content itself, text-based.

A straightforward solution, which is often used in software, is the README file. It is a text file in which general information *about* the project is collected. 
The main advantage of this is that, when using version control, this file will always be stored and versioned together with the contents.
