# Get involved

As this manual shows, the `papermill` project is merely starting to be a complete solution for 'machine writers'.

The rest of this chapter is a collection of ideas, which is supposed to show the direction I want to take with this project once it is released and **`open source`**.

But people are much more important than ideas. If you like (parts of) this document and want `papermill` to suceed, *you, the reader* have to get involved.
As with any open source project, there is a wide range of possible involvement, starting from just [simple feedback](mailto://papermill@178.is), to structured feedback in the form of bug reports and feature requests, writing and fixing documentation, design and software.

## Learning Resources

(listed in ascending order of experience)

- "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke [[-@guide:eloquentjs]]
- "JavaScript Pocket Reference" [[-@guide:jspocket]]
- "The Idiomatic JS Styleguide" [[@url:idiomaticjs]]
- "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford [[-@guide:goodparts]]
- "Node: Up and Running" [[-@guide:noderun]]

## Challenges Ahead

### all-in-one web interface

- combine the main tool chain into a single web app
- be more opinionated than the framework to lessen complexity

- *Collaboration*: check git for changes from collaborator and give warnings before merge conflicts can 

- *Formatting management*: find/replace for markup of specific words
    - check for consistency
    - integrate the style guide into the editor (choose to mark up "strong emphasis" or even *'Fremdwort'*)


### Translations

Translating a book is no easy task. Even **`git`** can't really help us here, at least not in a straightforward, standard workflow.

A quick look at the [repository of Scott Chacons book "Pro Git"](https://github.com/progit/progit), which was translated into more than 10 languages, reveals that just adding a new translation itself is easy enough. The ["README" states](https://github.com/progit/progit#translation): 

> "If you wish to translate the book, [`â€¦`] please put your translation into the appropriate subdirectory of this project, using the ISO 639 and send a pull request." [-@url:progitreadme, Lines 42-46]
