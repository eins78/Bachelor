# Writing

“EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!! NO MORE TYPEWRITERS [`...`] If word processing is so neat, then let’s all use it! Goal: by 1-1-81, NO typewriters at Apple… We believe the typewriter is obsolete. Let’s prove it inside before we try and convince our customers.”

Michael Scott, President of Apple Computer, 1980 [9, p. 1]

## Text editor

Choose a text editor *you* are comfortable with.
It should support plain text, but even Microsoft Word does this (reluctantly).

Generally, we can distinguish between two different kinds of text editors: 

a) the very minimalistic editors, with limited functionality, like the ones that ship 
with an operating system (like Windows' `Notepad.exe` or Apple's `TextEdit.app`).
b) IDEs, integrated development environments
c) every step in between, of course

Recommendations: 

- [`TextMate`][tm] (Mac, openSource)
- [`SublimeText`][st] (Mac, Windows, Linux; not open source but friendly)
