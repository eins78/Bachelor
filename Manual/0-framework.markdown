# The (anti-)framework

![`papermill` 'software stack' in comparison](../_images/papermill-stack-1)

`papermill` aims to be a modular, decoupled framework.

In software, a ['framework'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) is an abstraction which solves a general problem in a reusable way. 

'Modular' means that the framework itself consist of already-existing
components, along with additional 'glue' software to better integrate them.

Being 'decoupled' means that the framework should still be useful if
a user uses only some of it's components.
