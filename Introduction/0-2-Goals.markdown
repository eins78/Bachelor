# Goals

- make the tools and workflows used in (open source) software developement more accessible for authors and writers
    - version control 
    - automation

- formalizing and documenting configuration and process

- cross-media publishing
    * 1 input, many outputs

- reproducibility 
    * open standard for publication 'packages'
    * long-term availabilty of the build toolchain through use of open source software 



# Implementation

The implementation of the goals happens in the form of real-world prototypes. 
This means a minimal working solution is developed while producing an actual publication.
