## About this document

This is the theoretical part of my bachelor thesis, 'Papermill'.
For the sake of usefulness, it doubles as the first version of an
end user's manual for the practical part of the thesis: a framework for writing and publishing long-form text using open source software, also named `papermill.`

The instructional character has several implications regarding its structure. 
For one, it is split into two documents.

After enumerating the goals of the project and how they are planned to be achieved, 
the **Introduction** starts with a [Glossary](#glossary).
It explains several important technical topics,
followed by an overview to most important theoretical aspects of my research and practical work. This should serve as a foundation, familiarizing the reader with the general concepts and problems in the scope of this project.

The **Manual** is a step-by-step description of how to use the `papermill` framework to produce a publication. It will evolve alongside the framework.

The thesis is accompanied by following two attachments:

- Papermill: **`C0DE`**: Here, the complete and in large parts annotated source code of the `mill` Command Line Utility can be inspected. 

    It is a homage to both the concept of ['literate programming'](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html) coined by Donald Knuth as well as the almost forgotten tradition of including documentation with technical products in order to empower the end user through knowledge about the system.

- Papermill: **Source**: Since the entire thesis is also [produced using the framework laid out in it][dogfooding], the final attachment is its own source code.
