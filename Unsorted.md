While the document can be internally seperated into distinct parts, these always have a sequential order, so that the comlete text can be seen as a single stream.[^fn-linearhypertext]

[^fn-linearhypertext]: This is not a contradiction to the concept of 'Hypertext', where one part of a document can 'link' to a different section of or even a completely different document â€“ this is possible regardless of the linearity of the document(s).

There are certainly projects which don't adhere to this structure, like a **`wiki`**, possibly consisting of thousands of documents. 
While they could theoretically be 'linearized' (for example by sorting them alphabetically); 
and thus technically could be used as in 'input', these are outside of the scope of `papermill`.
