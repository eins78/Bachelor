# Versioning

In general, *versioning* is the act of collecting, labeling, ordering and indexing all the different revisions of a document. 
By extension, this also tracks the *changes* made between those revisions, making it possible to retrace the developement of the document and possibly even the thought process of the author.

These these drafts and revisions and their comparison have spawned
diverse studies of these topics in the literary sciences, yet there is a danger of loosing this raw material as more and more authors move to produce their textual work using a computer.

This danger was also my personal starting point for this whole project, 
sparked by Cory Doctorow's essay "Extreme Geek" [[@blog:Cory:Geek]], where he talks about this problem and how he solved it for himself. 
As Doctorow summarizes in a blog post:

> "I was prompted to do this after discussions with several digital archivists who complained that, prior to the computerized era, writers produced a series complete drafts on the way to publications, complete with erasures, annotations, and so on. These are archival gold, since they illuminate the creative process [â€¦]. By contrast, many writers produce only a single (or a few) digital files that are modified right up to publication time, without any real systematic records of the interim states between the first bit of composition and the final draft."

Being a blogger, digital activist and all-round-nerd, he falls into the target group of 'technical involved' authors, so it comes a no surprise that he found a higly technical solution. He commisoned a piece of software ([`flashbake`](https://github.com/commandline/flashbake)), which automatically keeps track of his work in 15-minute-intervals.



Underneath, it uses the **`git`** version control system
