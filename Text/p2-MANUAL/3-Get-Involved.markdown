# Get involved

As this manual shows, the `papermill` project is merely starting to be a complete solution for 'machine writers'.

The rest of this chapter is a collection of ideas, which is supposed to show the direction I want to take with this project once it is released and **`open source`**.

But people are much more important than ideas. If you like (parts of) this document and want `papermill` to suceed, *you, the reader* have to get involved.
As with any open source project, there is a wide range of possible involvement, starting from just [simple feedback](mailto://papermill@178.is), to structured feedback in the form of bug reports and feature requests, writing and fixing documentation, design and software.

## Learning Resources

- The Idiomatic JS 'Styleguide [@url:idiomaticjs]

## `TODO`

### all-in-one web interface

- combine the main tool chain into a single web app
- be more opinionated than the framework to lessen complexity

- *Collaboration*: check git for changes from collaborator and give warnings before merge conflicts can 

- *Formatting management*: find/replace for markup of specific words
    - check for consistency
    - integrate the style guide into the editor (choose to mark up "strong emphasis" or even *'Fremdwort'*)
