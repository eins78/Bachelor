# The (anti-)framework    {#manual}

Papermill is a modular, decooupled framework.

"Modular" means many parts working together.

decoupled means the you can choose from the parts
and they will also wrk if some are missing (dependencies)

some things are coupled, though, to make it easier
that means the actual content format
as well as the metadata.

the metadata are also build instructions. they define how to output
the content, in an open format.
this has several implications:
- more future proof
- can be supported by multiple tool, services, projects, â€¦
