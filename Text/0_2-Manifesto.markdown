## Manifesto


For my Bachelor thesis I will focus on the process of 
producing and publishing books and similar types long-from text. 
This most basic form of content creation has always changed 
along with available tools and other technical aspects.
In the age of general- and special-purpose, globally 
interconnected computing devices I have a special interest
in the role of the authors and their workflow.

The author as the creator, is the 
one sure constant in a rapidly changing publishing environment, 
which turns everyone with access to these devices into a 
potential self-publishing author.

The tools for writing, managing and publishing textual content
have advanced to a great deal, especially since the widespread
usage of rich web applications (aka "Web 2.0"), yet when it 
comes to addressing the complexities involved while handling 
whole books or large academic papers, they leave much to be desired. 

This is especially interesting when compared to the state of 
the tools for software development, since conceptually, there 
is no difference between a natural written language and a 
programming language. Both have conventions like syntax
and grammar, need to be parsed, compiled, and are best put under
a version control system.

Consequentially, there is a subset of technically involved authors
already using these tools created for software development to write
"normal" text.

My goal is to a) alleviate some of the common problems for these 
authors by further formalizing the "mode of production" and 
b) integrating and automating this process as good as possible, to
make these advances usable for non-technical authors as well.

For the practical part I am developing `bookstrap`, an eBook-like web interface
for books to be read in the modern web; to be integrated with my 
ongoing open source project *papermill*, which accordingly
will be used to produce and publish the theoretical part itself.

> `papermill` is a **toolchain for cross-publishing long-form text** to different media. The text can be something like an academic paper, an essay like static websites, an Ebook or a printable PDF.

**TL;DR:** Microsoft Word is evil. "What you see is" NOT "what you get".
Write with a nice plain text syntax instead and export to PDF and Web.
Also, version control will save your life some day.
